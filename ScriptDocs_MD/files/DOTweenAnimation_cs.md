### メソッド (Methods)
| アクセス | 名前 | 引数 | 戻り値 | 説明 |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `private` | S Dispatch_OnReset | DOTweenAnimation anim | `Void` |  |
| `private` | ⚡ Awake |  | `Void` | Unity Event Function |
| `private` | ⚡ Start |  | `Void` | Unity Event Function |
| `private` | ⚡ Reset |  | `Void` | Unity Event Function |
| `private` | ⚡ OnDestroy |  | `Void` | Unity Event Function |
| `public` | RewindThenRecreateTween |  | `Void` | Creates/recreates the tween without playing it, but first rewinding and killing the existing one if present. |
| `public` | RewindThenRecreateTweenAndPlay |  | `Void` | Creates/recreates the tween and plays it, first rewinding and killing the existing one if present. |
| `public` | RecreateTween |  | `Void` | Creates/recreates the tween from its target's current value without playing it, but first killing the existing one if present. |
| `public` | RecreateTweenAndPlay |  | `Void` | Creates/recreates the tween from its target's current value and plays it, first killing the existing one if present. |
| `public` | CreateTween | Boolean regenerateIfExists, Boolean andPlay | `Void` | Creates the tween manually (called automatically if AutoGenerate is set in the Inspector)<br>from its target's current value. |
| `public` | GetTweens |  | `List`1` | Returns the tweens (if generated and not killed) created by all DOTweenAnimations on this gameObject,<br>in the same order as they appear in the Inspector (top to bottom).<br>Note that a tween is generated inside the Awake call (except RectTransform tweens which are generated inside Start),<br>so this method won't return them before that |
| `public` | SetAnimationTarget | Component tweenTarget, Boolean useTweenTargetGameObjectForGroupOperations | `Void` | Sets the animation target (which must be of the same type of the one set in the Inspector).<br>This is useful if you want to change it BEFORE this<br>creates a tween, while after that it won't have any effect.<br>Consider that a  creates its tween inside its Awake (except for special tweens),<br>so you will need to sure your code runs before this object's Awake (via ScriptExecutionOrder or enabling/disabling methods) |
